          What is 'fine art'? What is 'chair art'?ü™ë Who sat in that chair and
          what did the cloud do with them? The artist traverse dimensions into

          Imagine a cow as a sphere.üêÆ A spherical cow is the quintessential
          cow. So why then are not cows, and all matter for that matter,
          spheres? The artist gives us a lesson in entropy and the second law of
          thermodynamics with their mind-blowing geometries.
